<h2> <p align="center">  <b> Essay: Analyzing The Spoken World Mapping Project</b> </p> </br>
<h3><b> Overview</b></br>
<h4> <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The digital geography related project I am analyzing and critiquing is <a href="https://mikus31.github.io/the-spoken-world/">The Spoken World</a> by Michael McNeil. It is an interactive worldwide webmap of location name pronunciations. The cartographer was inspired by his inability to help his nine year cousin, Asher, say <a href="https://github.com/mikus31/the-spoken-world">Icelandic</a> places for his school assignment. Ultimately, Michael wanted to find out how locals pronounce their hometown opposed to the standard pronunciation. At the time, he was a student at the <a href="https://newmapsplus.as.uky.edu/explore-new-maps">University of Kentucky</a>, so he took it upon himself to build an interactive, thematic webpage for the purpose of teaching himself and others an acceptable and non-offensive way of saying location names.
</br>
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major function of the webpage is the click event where it highlights each numbered cluster marker with a polygon after hovering over them. Each click results in the page zooming inward. Markers simultaneously break into smaller circles or red markers with location names. The zoom feature is an alternative way of accomplishing this. Another function is the switchboard with radio buttons located at the top right. The user has the option of choosing between a light and dark basemap. A simple, yet useful function is the ability to minmize the splash window with either the arrow or list icons. There is also an attribution 'i' button that displays information such as who the map maker is and data sources, when it is clicked.
</br>
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the webpage is nice to look at and fun to play with, it is unfortunately missing key map elements. There is no legend to tell the user what the symbols are, what the colors represent and what the numerical values mean. Additionally, it is without a scale bar and north arrow. They are necessary to communicate to the reader what the purpose is and what the content is about. There is a title, which I have not been able to implement as a beginner level map maker. This is something I appreciate. Additionally, Michael provides an attribution link and citation of sources. These are required components when making a webpage or project as they give proper credit and gives the user tools to produce a map of their own.
</br>
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intended audience are either beginner level cartographers and those who are curious about saying location names at an accceptable level where locals would not find it offensive. The implementation, functions and code are a bit more sophisticated than what an undergraduate geography major at the University of Washington would be able to do. However, I, as an undergraduate find the code extremely useful and may incorporate them in future projects. Up and coming map makers would also benefit from this webmap as the handling events are tough, but achievable. Besides those who have a difficult time pronouncing a place name, globetrotters can also use this project to better relate with locals.

<h3><b>Pros and Cons</b></br>
<h4><p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One reason why I chose this project to analyze oppose to others is, it is visually pleasing. At first glance, my eyes could not help but be attracted to the choice of colors and setup of the map. In my opinion, one huge flaw that beginner to mid level cartographers make is selecting the wrong color scheme. I am guilty of this. Michael selected bright and fun colors such as yellow and orange that are not only nice to look at, but they go hand-in-hand with the purpose of the project. Additionally, the map is set at a perfect scale as you are able to clearly see the study/geography area and points of interest to understand the intended use. Another thing that I absolutely love are the numerous handling events. One is the ability to toggle back and forth between two basemaps via radio buttons. The choices are simple and brilliant - light and dark. Another interactive event that makes a world of a difference is the splash window. Not only does it contain a share button with working url links, but there is an option to contract it. Furthermore, Michael provides an attribution or more information icon ('i') that displays a ton of information. A few include data sources, mapping libraries and an about me segment. As an aspiring cartographer, I find this extremely helpful and will incorporate a similar style in the future. The last positive that is worth mentioning is the result from clicking on a numbered cluster marker. As you click on a circle, it quickly breaks apart into smaller circles or red markers with the name of the zoomed in location. This can also be done using the zoom button. I find this useful because as a user, I like to have options.</br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the interactive webpage project has a lot of positive traits, I noticed a few cons. The obvious one is the inoperable audio option. This could be due to a flaw in the code or the cartographer disabling or removing part of it. Regardless, I was looking forward to hearing the right pronounciation of the location names. After all, the project is built around this. The only other negative is, the webpage is missing two necessary map elements - legend and scale. While the splash page window includes a brief summary of the project, I had to click on the associated Github to clarify any misunderstanding. A map legend is essential for the reader to grasp what the symbols, color scheme and numerical values represent.</p><p align="left"></p></br>
